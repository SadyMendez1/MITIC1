# MITIC
 okay, here are all the works that they gave us in the mitic.
 in the "sady" folder you will find the following folders: practice-master, practice_east_asia, practice_empanadas and practice_korean_culture.
 each folder contains the contents given in the classes, with the exception of the first folder, in which are the files used by the teachers.
